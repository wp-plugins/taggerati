WP-Taggerati is a port of my Taggerati plugin for Pivot. It's not a direct port 
but it has been improved quite a lot along the way. It combines ease of use
with advanced features. Installation is fairly straightforward. Follow the
instructions exactly and you'll be fine. First read the INSTALLATION section
in this document. When it's installed, read the USING TAGGERATI section 
further down below.

For a demo of this plugin in action visit:

INSTALLATION

1) Place the entire 'Taggerati' directory inside your WordPress plugins 
   directory (wp-content/plugins). Go to your Plugins section and
   activate the Taggerati Plugin.

2) Create a new page template. Templates are in your 
   wp-content/themes/your_theme_name directory. 

   In this page template you can put whatever you want but in the area
   where the main content goes enter the following tag:

   <?php tgr_tag_page(); ?>  

   For your convenience I've added a template for the stock 'Kubrick' theme
   in Taggerati/extras. Copy it to your template directory if you use a
   default installation. On a default  WP installation it's in:

   wp-content/themes/default

   If you use another template you'll have to create a template yourself!
   The example template that comes with this plugin is:

   extras/tagpage.php

   Add the following comment to the template:

  /*
  Template Name: Tagpage
  */

  This will make it show up in the list of page templates to choose from
  when creating a new page.

3) Go to Manage->Pages in the WP admin application. Click 'Create New Page'.
   As a title enter 'tags', uncheck 'allow comments' and 'allow pings'.
   Enter nothing in the Page Content area. Enter 'tags' in the 'page slug'
   field.

   Choose the Tagpage template as a page template for it.

4) You can now use three different tags in your other page templates:

   - <?php tgr_tagsinpost(); ?> (a space separated list of tags
     used in a post. Use this in the template that shows a single
     post. usually it's called single.php)
   - <?php tgr_posts_with_tags(); ?> (adds a lists of related posts
     based on tags used in the current post)

   Again for your convenience I've added a modified version of
   single.php for the stock Kubrick template. You can find it in
   Taggerati/extras. Just copy it into your wp-content/templates/default
   directory if you use the stock Kubrick template. If not, study it
   and you'll see how to use the tags.

   - <?php tgr_tag_cloud(number); ?> (this is an optional tag to render
     a tags cloud. if a value is entered between the brackets the 
     amount of tags will be limited. On the Taggerati demo site it's
     in the side bar, limited to the 15 most important tags.

TROUBLESHOOTING

1) Make the directory Taggerati/rssCache world writable (chmod 777)

USING TAGGERATI

Tagging was never this easy! There are three ways to make a tag, 
directly in your posting. After following the installation 
instructions listed in the previous section, using these three
tags are all you'll ever need to do to use Taggerati. The tag
database will be automatically updated when you save your post
with new tags in it or with tags removed.

1: Basic

   <tag>wordpress</tag>

   This creates a tag called wordpress linking to your local
   tag page for wordpress.

2: External URL

   <tag url="http://www.wordpress.org/">wordpress</tag>

   This creates a tag called wordpress linking to the wordpress
   homepage.

3: Invisible

   <itag>wordpress</itag>

   This creates an invisible tag. This means it doesn't appear in 
   the text of your posting but ONLY in the tags list generated
   by the template tag <?php tgr_tagsinpost(); ?> as described in
   step 6 of the installation section. Note that if you use this,
   you MUST use that template tag or it won't be harvested by
   any tag aggregator service such as Technorati.

In Options->Taggerati you can set the maximum and minimum sizes
for words in your tag clouds in percents and various other options 
the tagpage and the way lists are displayed.

That's it. Happy Tagging!
